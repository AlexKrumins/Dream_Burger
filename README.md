# What the project does:
The project provides a user with a front-end interface that interacts with a globally accessable database.
# Why the project is useful:
The project demonstrates the coder's ability to:
- Hand roll ORM
- Build Schema and Seeds for a database
- Create controllers to send queries the database
- Use the GET/PUT/POST/(DELETE) ajax codes to manipulate database
- Use the responses from the queries along with Handlebars & CSS to build HTML page
- Deploy to Heroku using process.env.port
# How users can get started with the project
Note how the left side of the page is populated with Burgers to be devoured and the right side is populated by Burgers that have been devoured already.
The buttons to devour/recreate the Burgers change their Boolean value within the database.
By creating their own burger to add to the menu, the user sends a unique entry to the database.
